# Chatroom Project
## Synopsis

This is a chatroom project that follows the "What's The Dealio" protocol for CMPT 352. 

Write a client-server chat room application. The program will operate as follows: The server application listens to a specified port for client connections who wish to join the chat room. The server keeps track of all client connections in the chat room. A client joins the chatroom according to their username - their name for the chat session. Once the client has connected to the chatroom server, the client may then send a message to the chatroom where it will be broadcast to all members of the chatroom. A client may also send a private message to one other member in the chatroom.
